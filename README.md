## **Project Description**

Falls are one of the major causes of injury and death among elderly people. Many senior citizens live alone or may not be able to call for help after an accident. This project aims to solve this problem by creating a **wearable fall detection device** that continuously monitors the user’s movement.

When a sudden fall is detected, the system automatically sends an **emergency alert message** to predefined contacts such as family members and doctors. This allows faster response, timely medical support, and helps reduce the risk of serious injury or death.
